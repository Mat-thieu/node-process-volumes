# Process Volumes

API to check how much volume is emitted by other applications.

## Usage

Using this library is as easy as one function call:
`require('process-volumes').getProcessVolumes()`

This returns an array with objects, each object representing an
individual process with attributes for the process ID, process name and
their currently emitted volume.

## Data Structure

The data returned by getProcessVolumes() looks like this:

```json
[
  { processId: 0, processName: '', peakVolume: 0 },
  { processId: 1234, processName: 'example.exe', peakVolume: 0.75 },
  { processId: 1834, processName: 'sample.exe', peakVolume: 0.13 }
]
```

## Example

```js
// This application prints all applications with their currently emitted
// volume and process names.
var processVolumes = require('process-volumes');

var processes = processVolumes.getProcessVolumes();
console.log('Current applications with their volumes:');
processes.forEach(function (process) {
  if (process.processName) {
    console.log(process.processName + ': ' + process.peakVolume);
  } else {
    console.log('(Unknown): ' + process.peakVolume);
  }
});
```

## Support

Currently only a Windows implementation has been created. Contributions
for other operating systems are welcome :)
